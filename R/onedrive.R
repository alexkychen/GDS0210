#' Simulate frequency of a regular gene drive over time in a population 
#' 
#' This function simulate how long it takes a regular gene drive to spread out the entire population, given the number of released individuals, population size, and other biological parameters.
#' @param pop.size An integer to specify a population size
#' @param release A vector of two integers to indicate the number of individuals (first is female; second is male) carrying gene drive to be released to the populaton. release = c(100, 50) means 100 females and 50 males carrying the drive are released to the population.
